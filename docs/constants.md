# Constants

Constants are predefined values used in the Agiliate Engine. They are documented in the [constant.ts](../src/calculations/interfaces/constant.ts) file

The `constants` property holds the default constants for the calculations. The `customConstants` property can be used to override the default constants.

An example of a constant is `governmentMinimumSquaremetersPerWorkSpace`. It is used to define the minimum square meters per workspace required by the government. The default value can be overridden in the `customConstants` object.
