# Variables

The IVariable interface in the codebase represents a set of variables used in the calculations. They are sent to the application as a *POST request* at the `calculate` enpoint. See the example [Postman collection](../postman_collection.json)

The variables are documented in the [variables.ts](../src/calculations/interfaces/variable.ts) file.
